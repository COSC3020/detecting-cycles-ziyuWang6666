# Detecting Cycles in Graphs

Kruskal's Algorithm adds edges to the minimum spanning tree, unless they would
add a cycle. In the lectures, we did not talk about how to do this -- you're
going to implement a function to detect cycles in a graph. Start with the
template I provided in `code.js`. You can use any data structures (i.e. any
graph representation) you like. The function should return `true` or `false`,
depending on whether the given graph contains a cycle or not.

I have not provided any test code; you can base yours on test code from other
exercises.
