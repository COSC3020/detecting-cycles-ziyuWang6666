# Detecting Cycles in Graphs

Kruskal's Algorithm adds edges to the minimum spanning tree, unless they would
add a cycle. In the lectures, we did not talk about how to do this -- you're
going to implement a function to detect cycles in a graph. Start with the
template I provided in `code.js`. You can use any data structures (i.e. any
graph representation) you like. The function should return `true` or `false`,
depending on whether the given graph contains a cycle or not.

I have not provided any test code; you can base yours on test code from other
exercises.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.



### Answer
The implementation has a worst-case complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. 


The overall time complexity is O(V+E), with constant time complexities of O(1) for Graph constructor and addEdge methods, O(E) for isCyclicUtil function, and O(V) for isCyclic method.
